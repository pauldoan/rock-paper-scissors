# rock-paper-scissors

The classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. In the unexisting possibility that you don't know the rule:

- You select a item, either rock 🗿, paper 🧻, or scissors ✂️
- Your opponent does the same
- rock 🗿 crushes the scissors ✂️, paper 🧻 wraps up the scissors ✂️, scissors ✂️ cuts the paper 🧻 apart
